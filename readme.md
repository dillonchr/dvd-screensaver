# DVD Screensaver
I was looking through XScreenSaver's collection earlier and I got to feeling nostalgic about screensavers. They don't really matter anymore but when I was younger I remember looking for awesome screensavers for days on end. Or so it felt in my mind. I thought it'd be fun to tinker with electron and Windows to resurrect a classic.

This project is very bare-bones. Bootstrapped with `create-electron-app` and glued together with a few *StackOverflow* answers.

There are no settings to configure. And as of now, no release. I'm still trying to understand how to get a packaged exe added to my screensavers.

The best thing to try is just to `npm i` and `npm start` to launch the screensaver. It will behave as if it were really a screensaver now. So any keystrokes, or mouse movements will close the app.

Happy hacking!
